This code for the Raspberry Pi Pico W supports the built-in BME-280 and MPU-6050 sensors on the Main board and adds support for Adafruit.io

To use this code, you will need to create a Free account at https://io.adafruit.com

You will need to configure your Adafruit.io account information and your WiFi credentials in the edit_this_config_and_rename.h file

You will then compile your code using the Arduino IDE (It can be modified to use other IDEs)

For information on how to compile the code, see https://github.com/alanbjohnston/CubeSatSim/wiki/Adding-New-Sensors

You will need a micro USB cable to connect your computer to the Raspberry Pi Pico W.
